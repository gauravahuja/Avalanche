Avalanche, IIT Bombay, Techfest 2011

The aim of the competition was to build a computer controlled bot which can collect and deposit balls rolling down a ramp with the help of overhead/onboard camera.

There are balls of three different colours. The robot had to catch the blue and red balls and drop them in the left and right pits respectively and had to escape the black balls.

I used OpenCV to track the robot and the balls. At the hardware front I used an ATmega8 board and RF for communication between the Robot and my laptop.

The code was written in C++ using Microsoft visual studio 2008 and OpenCV 2.1 SDK. MCU code was written in C using AVR Studio and compiled using WINAVR sdk.
